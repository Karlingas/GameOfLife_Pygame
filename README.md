# GameOfLife_Pygame

A simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life in Python using Pygame for visualization.

## Features

Live Simulation: Watch the cellular automaton evolve in real time.
Pause & Resume: Control the simulation with a button.
Interactive Editing: Click on cells to toggle their state (alive/dead).
Resizable Window: The grid adapts dynamically when resizing the window, keeping the previous state.
## Installation

## Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karlingas/GameOfLife_Pygame.git
cd GameOfLife_Pygame
```
Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pygame
```
Run the simulation
```bash
python game_of_life.py
```

## Controls

Left-click on a cell to toggle its state.
Click the "PAUSE" button to pause or resume the simulation.
Resize the window to expand or contract the grid without losing its state.
About Conwayâ€™s Game of Life

The Game of Life is a zero-player game where cells evolve based on simple rules:

Any live cell with fewer than 2 or more than 3 neighbors dies.
Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
This leads to complex and interesting emergent patterns!
